Abacus is a 3D maths library for the [CLI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure), built with a primary focus on performance and efficiency.  Abacus is ideal for use developing real-time 3D applications and deterministic network simulations.

Abacus supports similar features to the mathematical portions of the XNA framework, however, Abacus is written to support more than just single precision floating point calculations.  Abacus currently supports Single, Double and Fixed32 precision real number calculations.
